DESCRIPTION:
This project is a real-time chat application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. It uses WebSockets via Socket.io to establish a two-way communication between the client (browser) and the server (Node.js).

✅ Users can:

Open the chat app in multiple windows or devices.
Type messages and send them in real-time.
See messages appear instantly without refreshing the page.
2️⃣ Technologies Used
We used a combination of frontend and backend technologies to build this chat app:

Frontend (Client-Side)
🔹 HTML - Structure of the chat page
🔹 CSS - Styling for a clean UI
🔹 JavaScript - Handles real-time chat events
🔹 Socket.io (Client) - Listens for incoming messages from the server

Backend (Server-Side)
🔹 Node.js - Backend server to handle chat communication
🔹 Express.js - Lightweight web framework for routing
🔹 Socket.io (Server) - Enables real-time messaging

3️⃣ How It Works (Step-by-Step Flow)
1️⃣ User Opens the Chat App
The user opens index.html in their browser.
The browser connects to the Node.js server using Socket.io.
2️⃣ User Sends a Message
When a user types a message and clicks "Send," the message is sent to the server via WebSockets.
3️⃣ Server Broadcasts the Message
The Node.js server receives the message and forwards it to all connected users.
4️⃣ Other Users See the Message Instantly
The chat message appears in all open browser windows in real time.
